**Tip-A-Trip** is a travel platform

| Problem  | Solution |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Planning holiday itineraries is time-consuming  | A platform with a collection of users' itineraries to take inspiration from  |
| After you go on holiday, your holiday itinerary rarely gets seen again  | The platform also allows you to share your past trips with other users (and family/friends) and enables you to relive your trips  |
