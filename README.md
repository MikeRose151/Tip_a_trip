TIP-A-TRIP
Tip-A-Trip is a travel platform

--------------------------------------

THE PROBLEM(S) AND THE SOLUTION(S)
[TRY TO HAVE THIS AS A TABLE AS IT'S VISUALLY EASIER]

Tip-A-Trip solves 2 problems:
(i) Planning holiday itineraries is time-consuming
(ii) After you go on holiday, your holiday itinerary rarely gets seen again

The solutions to the abovementioned problems:
(i) A platform with a collection of userâ€™s itineraries to take inspiration from, or to use as is
(ii) The platform also allows you to share your past trips with other users (and family/friends) and enables you to relive your trips
